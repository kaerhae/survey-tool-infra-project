# survey-tool

Simple backend server, which handles surveys with following operations

    - Creating a survey
    - Listing surveys
    - Listing one survey
    - Post answered survey
    - Delete one survey

Keeping backend server nice and simple, so we have a easy possibility to study following technologies:

## Prometheus

TODO: Monitoring

TODO MAYBE: alerts

## Grafana

### Loki
TODO: Log management

## Traefik

TODO: Reverse proxy, https


Also if there is still interest, maybe to study following other technologies:

## Kubernetes / K3s

TODO: Pods, services, ingress


## Splunk

TODO: Database monitoring(?), data management

## Elastic search

TODO: data queries
